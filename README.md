# Project: Komodo Documentation

This repository stores all public documentation for Komodo Digital. It is open
source and we accept pull requests. The repository also demonstrates to Komodo's developers
how to use [Komodo WordPress Documentation](https://bitbucket.org/komodohq/komodo-wordpress-documentation).

## Notes / Todos
 - _**TODO**_: The system is currently using a WordPress patch hosted on dropbox by a 3rd party. Need to replace with our own.
